* All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (``$ wc -l file`` should print 2)
* All your files should end with a new line ([why?](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file/18789))

### More Info
*Example of line count and first line*
```
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ wc -l 12-file_type
2 12-file_type
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ head -n 1 12-file_type
#!/bin/bash
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$
```
In order to test your scripts, you will need to use this command: ``chmod u+x file``. We will see later what does ``chmod`` mean and do, but you can have a look at ``man chmod`` if you are curious.

*Example*
```
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ls
12-file_type
lll
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ls -la lll
-rw-rw-r-- 1 julien julien 15 Sep 19 21:05 lll
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ cat lll
#!/bin/bash
ls
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ls -l lll
-rw-rw-r-- 1 julien julien 15 Sep 19 21:05 lll
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ chmod u+x lll # you do not have to understand this yet
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ls -l lll
-rwxrw-r-- 1 julien julien 15 Sep 19 21:05 lll
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ./lll
